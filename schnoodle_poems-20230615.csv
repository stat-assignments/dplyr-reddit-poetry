&That's right, this baby needs a mom -

I'll be the one to keep him calm 

upon my back he likes to cling,

n oh, the Joy that he will bring!

for i've had kittens of my own - 

they wander  off,

n i'm alone&

i worry, n they leave me stress,

but this one brings me 

Happiness ^;}

for he's not ready yet to part -

he's wrapped himself

around by heart
