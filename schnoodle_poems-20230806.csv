their memory

you'll hear his spirit, 'Happy'

Fighting back Flames -'*NOT TODAY!*' he would bark!

I need the origin story of this friendship&*'

____

i remember when i saw you, back when i was just a fawn

you were just a puppy, n you ran across the lawn

momma said '*be careful, babe - he isn't one of us...'*

your human said '*You'll Scare her!'* (oh, those mommas sure can Fuss!)

but after all these years, my friend, we sure did prove them wrong

cuz now we're still together, n with You's where i belong

n now i share my babes with you, a trusted friend, so dear

Thank you for the memories

I'm glad that you're still here!

*'Hang on, dear friend Vixen! I'm waiting for You!*'

n then,  out of nowhere,  the humans appeared

they yelled *'Keep your Head up - we're Friends!*' as they neared

they pulled on my antlers with all of their might,

Prancer looked on - i knew i'd be all right!

determined to free me from my snowy grave,

the Kindness of friends is what kept me so brave

at last they succeeded! i wobbled away,

a lesson was learned on that cold snowy day

when things look the darkest there's Hope if you find

the love of a Friend

they're missing a lot if they don't understand -

 *'just for some cats*'& n the things they demand&

you feed a small kitten you find as a stray,

*he'll  stay for a while, then he'll be on his way&'*

the days turn to weeks, then months to a year,

(you forget what your life was before he  appeared&)

n then it occurs *oh, this cat needs a bro!*'

as off to the shelter you eagerly go

now bonded together, you have a cat pair,

n all that you own you are willing to share 

the bed that was yours, n the table to eat,

happily danced on with little cat feet ^:} ^^;}

They've taken control now, your heart n your soul,

*'hey, i got you a Buggy! Let's go for a stroll&*'

(you know it's for You - you can't leave them behind)

Just for some cats' . . . 

evermore on your mind

am just a tiny turtle, living here inside my shell

i feel like i am ^*flying!* &or i'm *swimming ?* hard to tell&

sometimes it makes me wonder - what's below me, or *above ?*

there's places i will never see,

but it's my Shell i love ^^:)

i always have it with me, it's my home' i bring along

n in my dreams i swim,  or ^*Fly!* a little turtle, Strong!

i'm moving through the water, never worried bout my pace,

my momma always told me

*slow n steady wins the race&*

it's not the dEsTiNaTiOn, but the Journey that we find

the friends who mean the Most to us - the ones who treat us Kind

so i can go inside my shell, avoid the things that ScArE,

n nothings gonna hurt me

cuz i know i'm *safe*
