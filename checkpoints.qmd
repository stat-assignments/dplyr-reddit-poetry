# Problem 1: Split the poem into lines and create a data frame {#part1}

Here is some example formatted output from a poem selected from each poet's works to give you an idea of what I am expecting your code to produce (for all of the poems, not just for one single poem).

### Poem

[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gc4qru/what_is_something_that_is_expensive_but_only/fp9qu8a/?context=3)

    "It's Expensive Being Poor."

    "Besieged by a bill, or deficient in rent?
    Devoid of a dollar, bereft of a cent?
    Depleted, defeated, or beggared and broke?
    Well never you panic, you poorest of folk!

    "That mountain of debt that you're facing with dread?
    You pay with tomorrow's resources instead!
    Your future is waiting to fill your account -
    At charges quadruple the normal amount!

    "And if you're perturbed as you ponder the loan -
    That next month arrives with the bills of its own -
    That maybe you'll weep for your choices before -
    Then never you worry!

    … you just borrow more."

    he turns the water
    yellow...

# Problem 2: Poem Line Stats {#part2}


Note that if you've done any preliminary data cleaning, to e.g. remove quoted lines or trim white space, your answers may differ, and that is fine.
